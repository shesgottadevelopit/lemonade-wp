## Lemonade Wordpress Starter Theme  
Based on [Automattic's underscores](http://underscores.me/) starter Theme

**Updated on Friday 3/24/17**

This is a work in progress!
_I will continue to refine this starter until it fits my general needs._

Components  
- Singular.php can be used to replace single.php and page.php, reducing the number of pages used in the theme
- Partials contain blocks of reusable code that is called into each template file
- Component files beginning with `_` have not been formatted to clear the slate
- Functions.php includes google fonts enqueue scripts

Renaming (instructions snatched from underscores.me)
1. Search for `'_lemonade'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_lemonade_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _lemonade` in style.css.
4. Search for `<code>&nbsp;_lemonade</code>` (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_lemonade-` to capture prefixed handles.
